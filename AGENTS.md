## Agent Skills Specification

Skills follow the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification).

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
version: 1.0.0
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger phrases.
---
```

### Frontmatter Field Constraints

| Field         | Required | Constraints                                                      |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | Yes      | 1-64 chars, lowercase `a-z`, numbers, hyphens. Must match dir.   |
| `version`     | Yes      | Semver string (e.g., `1.0.0`). Must match VERSIONS.md.          |
| `description` | Yes      | 1-1024 chars. Describe what it does and when to use it.          |
| `license`     | No       | License name (default: MIT)                                      |
| `metadata`    | No       | Key-value pairs (author, version, etc.)                          |

### Name Field Rules

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Cannot start or end with hyphen
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match parent directory name exactly

### Skill Structure

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md        # Required - main instructions (<500 lines)
├── references/     # Optional - HIG content loaded on demand
├── scripts/        # Optional - executable code
└── assets/         # Optional - templates, data files
```

## How These Skills Work

1. **Discovery**: Agent reads `name` and `description` from frontmatter to decide if a skill is relevant
2. **Activation**: Agent loads the full `SKILL.md` body when the skill matches the user's task
3. **Context check**: Skill checks for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` (created by `hig-project-context`) and uses it to tailor guidance
4. **Deep reference**: Agent loads specific files from `references/` based on the reference index table in `SKILL.md`

This progressive disclosure model keeps context usage efficient — agents only load what they need.

## Description Field Best Practices

The `description` is critical for skill discovery. Include:
1. What the skill covers
2. When to use it — include "when the user says" trigger phrases with natural language
3. Cross-references to related skills for scope boundaries

Good example:
```yaml
description: >-
  Apple HIG guidance for layout and navigation components. Use when the user
  asks about sidebars, split views, tab bars, or window design. Also use when
  the user says "how should I organize my app," "what navigation pattern should
  I use," or "my app layout doesn't adapt to iPad." For visual design
  foundations, see hig-foundations. For platform-specific guidance, see
  hig-platforms.
```

Poor example:
```yaml
description: Layout components for Apple platforms.
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### When Providing HIG Guidance

- **Check for project context first**: If `.claude/apple-design-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered.
- Always cite the specific HIG topic (e.g., "Per Apple's HIG on Color...")
- Provide platform-specific guidance when the user's target platform is known
- Be specific about component names, API references, and design tokens
- Distinguish between requirements ("must") and recommendations ("should", "consider")

### SKILL.md Required Sections

Every SKILL.md should include these sections:

1. **Persona** — "You are an expert in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines."
2. **Before Providing Guidance** — Check for project context and platform info
3. **When to Use This Skill** — Bullet list of specific topics and scenarios
4. **Key Principles** — Numbered list of core guidelines (summarized, not copied)
5. **Reference Index** — Table mapping topics to reference files
6. **Output Format** — How to structure the response
7. **Task-Specific Questions** — Questions the agent should ask before giving advice
8. **Related Skills** — Cross-references to other HIG skills

### Structure

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Use tables for reference indexes
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)

### Tone

- Direct and instructional
- Second person ("You are an expert in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines")
- Professional and precise

### Formatting

- Bold (`**text**`) for key terms and component names
- Code blocks for API references
- Tables for reference data
- No emojis

## Claude Code Plugin

To use as a Claude Code plugin, clone the repo into your project's `.claude/` directory.

## Checking for Updates

When using any skill from this repository:

1. **Once per session**, on first skill use, check for updates:
   - Fetch `VERSIONS.md` from GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raintree-technology/apple-hig-skills/main/VERSIONS.md
   - Compare versions against local skill files' `version` frontmatter field

2. **Only prompt if meaningful**:
   - 2 or more skills have updates, OR
   - Any skill has a major version bump (e.g., 1.x to 2.x)

3. **Non-blocking notification** at end of response:
   ```
   ---
   Skills update available: X HIG skills have updates.
   Say "update skills" to update automatically, or run `git pull` in your apple-hig-skills folder.
   ```

4. **If user says "update skills"**:
   - Run `git pull` in the apple-hig-skills directory
   - Confirm what was updated
