# Apple HIG Skills

> 14 agent skills that give AI coding assistants deep knowledge of Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Built for Claude Code and the Agent Skills spec.

Apple HIG Skills packages the full [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) into structured, AI-ready agent skills. Each skill covers a specific HIG domain — platforms, foundations, components, patterns, inputs, and technologies — so AI agents can provide accurate, contextual Apple design guidance without hallucinating.
